# currency-converter

## Overview

As a software developer, my goal with this project is to deepen my understanding of working on the core client-side of JavaScript programming language.This currency converter allows users to convert amounts between different currencies using real-time exchange rates from an external API.

The purpose of creating this software is to improve my skills in JavaScript, handle API responses effectively, and enhance user experience through responsive design and clear data presentation.
